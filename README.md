# zoe
*zoe* is a video game engine that I am working on in my free time. It probably won't surpass *Unity3D* or *Unreal Engine* but where is the fun in using any of these if you can make your own!

I want it to be as optimized as possible but am limited to my free time.


## Compile
I still need to rewrite everything to CMake.
